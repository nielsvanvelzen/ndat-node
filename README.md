# ndat-node

This project is aiming to add an alternative for PHP to your webservers.
The goal is to allow simple JavaScript files (with custom extension) to be run when requested in the browser by just dropping the files in a folder without any further configuration.

This project is currently not stable enough for a release, but a working prototype is already available.
